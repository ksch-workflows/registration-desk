# Solution Strategy

## Design principles

> Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious you can do to make it better. - [Michael Feathers](https://cvuorinen.net/2014/04/what-is-clean-code-and-why-should-you-care/)

- TDD: Enable a stable code base which supports regular refactoring by test-driven development.
- SOLID: Keep the code base clear to understand by the application of the SOLID design principles.
