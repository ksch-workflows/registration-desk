# Context and Scope

The app depends upon the [Backend](https://github.com/ksch-workflows/backend) for the reading and writing of its data.
For this purpose, it is accessing the [REST API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api) of the backend with the help of the [K.S.C.H. Dart Client](https://github.com/ksch-workflows/ksch-dart-client).
